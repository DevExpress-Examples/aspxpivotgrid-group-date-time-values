# How to Group Date-Time Values


<p>Assume that the ASPxPivotGrid control is bound to a data table that contains an 'OrderDate' field. In the following example, two PivotGridField fields are created and displayed in the Column Header Area, each of them bound to the 'OrderDate' field. The first pivot grid field's values will be grouped by years, the second field's values will be grouped by months. To group data, the PivotGridFieldBase.GroupInterval property is used.</p>
